## About Saropa Contacts

Saropa is a private, cloud-connected address book that links real people, companies, and emergency groups. It is primarily focused on your trusted emergency groups. Our mission is to reduce the impact of crises everywhere.

In an emergency, get real-time access to all the important people, companies, and services you need - even if you don't know them personally, or if they're not where you expect them to be.

## Harmony

Bad coding is easy. The following rules make code simpler to read, review, maintain, and test. Maintain clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Follow naming conventions, prevent fragile code, be future-proof, and practice defensive programming.

### Write Clean, Maintainable, and Well-documented code

1.1.a üìù Use consistent and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid abbreviations and ensure names are descriptive of their purpose.

``` dart
    /// Use clear and descriptive names
    void fetchDataFromServer() {}

    /// Use ‚Äúdb‚Äù for database operations
    void dbFetchUser() {}

    /// Use ‚Äúapi‚Äù prefix for web calls
    void apiFetchData() {}

    /// Combine nouns and verbs clearly
    List<String> getUserList() {}

    /// Use ‚Äúis‚Äù prefix for boolean variables
    bool isLoading = true;
```

1.1.b üìê Maintain a separation of concerns. Small files and functions streamline code reviews, migrations and merges.

- Separate UI, models, services, and utilities into distinct folders, with patterns like MVVM or Clean Architecture.
- Keep state management logic separate from UI code, to ensure state changes are predictable and testable.
- Organize files by feature or module, named based on their functionality (e.g., `user_profile.code`)

1.1.c üéØ Exit early to avoid nested ifs and separate logic into methods

*BEFORE*: Succinct but difficult to read

``` dart
void checkAge(int age) {
   String result = '';

  if (age >= 18) {
    if (age < 65) {
      result = 'You are an adult.';
    } else {
      result = 'You are a senior citizen.';
    }
  } else {
    if (age < 2) {
      result = 'You are a baby.';
    } else if (age < 13) {
      result = 'You are a child.';
    } else {
      result = 'You are a teenager.';
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

*AFTER*: exit early, separated concerns, validate params, give more options

``` dart
String checkAge(int age) {
  final ageDisplayValue = getAgeDisplayValue(age);
  if (ageDisplayValue == null) {
    return 'Invalid age';
  }

  return 'You are a $ageDisplayValue.';
}

String? getAgeDisplayValue(int age) {
  if (age < 0) {
    return null;
  } else if (age < 2) {
    return 'baby';
  } else if (age < 13) {
    return 'child';
  } else if (age < 18) {
    return 'teenager';
  } else if (age < 65) {
    return 'adult';
  } else {
   return 'senior citizen';
  }
}
```

### Respect Our Users

> Companies that mishandle sensitive user data face severe legal and reputation consequences. Never risk unauthorized access or data breaches.

1.2.a üö® Never log sensitive user information - even to the user's device. Implement hashing strategies or encrypted in all outputs.
1.2.b ü•á Prevent accidents by applying consistent theming and respect accessibility across all UI components.
1.2.c üèÜ Always obtain explicit permission before collecting or sharing user data, regardless of its perceived importance or financial value. Clearly communicate your data practices and ensure users understand the implications of their choices.

### Future-Proof

1.4.a üí£ Do not write code that will cause issues in the future, such as hard-coded dates or temporary fixes.
1.4.b üèóÔ∏è Plan for the long-term maintainability and scalability of your code.
1.4.c ‚öôÔ∏è Use configuration files or environment variables instead of hard-coding values.
1.4.d üíé *Zero* warnings, hacks, or lints. And to-dos need to go in project management tools, never source.

### Defensive Programming (No Fragile Code)

1.5.a üêõ Implement thorough error handling to *gracefully* manage edge cases and unexpected situations.
1.5.b ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that all inputs are validated and sanitized

- Empty and null string checks simplify operations and clarify debugging
- Ensure indices don't exceed minimum / maximum allowed value (bound errors)
- Validate inputs to prevent malicious characters or invalid data.

> SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, buffer overflow, command injection, DoS, man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking are common examples of malicious inputs that can compromise application security.

1.5.c üíæ Avoid optimistic casting and utilize null safety features to avoid null errors

```dart
  // Optimistic casting (avoid) will *error* if the provided data in missing or a different format
  final nameError = jsonData['name'] as String;

  // Safe casting with `!`:
  final name = jsonData['name'] as String?;
  if (name == null || name.isEmpty) {
    // log or ignore
  } else {
    // do something
  }
```

1.3.d üßØ Avoid shortcuts that may lead to code breaking under unusual conditions.

- Handle exceptions within the method without throwing errors - unless the needed for parental logging.
- Log errors somewhere they can be review, but be mindful or leaking sensitive data

## Openness

Be transparent about your progress, skills, and contributions. Provide realistic estimates, update them regularly, and avoid false claims.

### Honest Prototyping

2.1.a üìù Don‚Äôt present prototypes as final, production-ready code. Set the right expectations with stakeholders to prevent misunderstandings and false hopes about the readiness of a feature.

2.1.b üí° Use prototypes for innovation ‚Äî to explore ideas and test solutions, without investing too much time or resources.

2.1.c üó£Ô∏è Seek feedback on prototypes to refine and improve.Involve team members and stakeholders early to gather diverse perspectives and iterate on the design based on constructive feedback.

2.3.b üîÑ Regularly update estimates as work progresses and new information becomes available. This helps manage expectations and allows for better planning and resource allocation.

2.3.c üì¢ Promptly communicate any changes in timelines to keeping stakeholders informed. This builds trust and allows for adjustments in project planning.

### Avoid False Claims

2.4.a ‚ùå Do not falsely claim credit for work you did not do or abilities you do not possess. Integrity is crucial for trust within your team and with stakeholders. Be clear about your contributions.

2.4.b üî¶ Recognize and celebrate your achievements, but also acknowledge the contributions of others. Transparency fosters a healthy and collaborative work environment.

2.4.c üå± Seek opportunities to learn and grow. Regularly assess your skills and identify areas for improvement. Pursue training, attend workshops, and seek mentorship to develop expertise.

### Understand ‚ÄúProduction-Ready‚Äù

6.3.a ‚öôÔ∏è Production-ready code is stable, well-tested, and optimized. Ensure your code has passed all necessary tests and can handle expected load.

6.3.b üêû Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix bugs before deployment. Provide comprehensive documentation for smooth deployment and maintenance.

## Networking

Work well with your team, communicate clearly, encourage questions, and put yourself in users' shoes. Maintain effective documentation.

### Collaboration

3.1.a ü§ù Share knowledge and supporting everyone in your team. Foster an environment of mutual respect and cooperation where everyone feels valued and heard.

3.1.b üó£Ô∏è Communicate clearly and effectively about your progress, challenges, and needs. Use regular updates and status meetings to keep everyone on the same page.

3.1.c üó®Ô∏è Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving feedback. Embrace feedback as a tool for growth, ensuring it is given respectfully and constructively.

3.2.a üì± Foster an environment where asking questions is encouraged and valued. Make it clear that there are no ‚Äústupid‚Äù questions and that curiosity drives improvement.

3.2.b üó∫Ô∏è Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength and a commitment to quality. Encourage team members to seek clarification to ensure tasks are completed accurately.

3.2.c ü§ó Provide mentorship and support to junior developers. Share your knowledge generously to help others grow, fostering a culture of continuous learning.

### Put Yourself in Users‚Äô Shoes

3.3.a üëü Consider the practicality and usability of features from the user's perspective. Think about how users will interact with your product and prioritize their needs.

- Similar elements should behave in similar ways and be located in familiar places to ensure predictability and intuitiveness.
- Group information hierarchically, hide complexity under "more" options, and use filters and search functionalities to make it manageable.
- Utilize labels, color, buttons, and diagrams, and incorporate accessibility features to enhance usability.
- Always provide a warning before performing any irreversible actions.
- Regularly ask users for their input to ensure the product meets their needs and expectations.

3.3.b üëÇ Ask questions and seek clarification to ensure the final product meets the user's needs. Engage with users through surveys and feedback sessions to gather insights.

3.3.c üìã Gather feedback from users to understand their needs and preferences. Use this feedback to refine and enhance your product, ensuring it aligns with user expectations.

### Effective Documentation

> If you have to explain something about the system to another person (in a review, to client, or in any other way) then it needs better documentation. No exceptions.

3.4.a üñãÔ∏è Use clear and concise language in all your documentation. Your audience includes both subject experts and those new to the project.

3.4.b üìë Maintain a consistent style and structure throughout your documentation and code comments. Consistency helps everyone navigate and understand the documentation more effectively.

3.4.c üåè Provide examples to illustrate abstract concepts and usage expectations. This helps others apply the information correctly.

3.4.d üÜô Why, Not How. Explain simply *why* we do something: stakeholder needs, things that went wrong, ideas, an evolved tech stack, legislation, or industry standards.

3.4.e üìÖ Integrate reviews into your project planning at milestones. Properly maintained documentation prevents confusion, reduces errors, and streamlines onboarding and training, ultimately saving time and resources.

3.4.f üñ®Ô∏è If the explanation of non-trivial logic or algorithms becomes too detailed, consider splitting the logic into separate methods or fields for better organization and reusability.

- Explain the purpose in doc headers. If a doc header is too detailed, it's a sign the method is too complex.
- Important parameters need explaining in the header.
- Use comments for complex logic (e.g., loops, nested functions)
- If the explanation becomes too detailed, the logic should be split into separate methods or fields.

> Documentation will help you write better code

### Measure

5.1.a üèÜ Base your optimization efforts on actual profiler data rather than assumptions. Data-driven decisions ensure that your optimization efforts are focused where they will have the most impact.

5.1.b üéØ Focus on optimizing areas that have a significant impact on performance. Not all slow parts of your code are worth optimizing. Focus on the parts that will make a noticeable difference.

5.1.c üìè Avoid premature optimization by writing clear and correct code first. Code must work correctly before you can make it faster, but poorly performing code is a sign of incorrectness.

### Unnecessary Calculations

5.2.a üßÆ Minimize expensive operations and optimize data storage and retrieval.

5.2.b üìè Delay or avoid performing calculations that aren't directly necessary for the task at hand.

5.2.c üìä Cache results of expensive or frequent computations.

### Efficient Structures and Algorithms

5.3.a üõµ Different data structures and algorithms have different performance characteristics, so choose the ones that are best suited to your needs.

- Use lists for better performance and easier manipulation.
- Prefer methods for caching complex logic instead of get/set fields: This provides a clearer separation of concerns and signals the parent component to implement caching.

5.3.b ‚öñÔ∏è Prefer simplicity and clarity over complexity unless performance requires otherwise. Simple code is easier to maintain and less likely to contain bugs.

5.3.c ‚öôÔ∏è Optimize data access patterns to reduce latency and improve throughput. Be mindful of how often and how you access data.

### Asynchronous Operations

5.4.a üíª Use asynchronous techniques to your application responsive, even for long-running tasks.

- Avoid heavy computations in run-first method (e.g. build)
- Always offload complex calculations and changeable data to streaming, listening and future objects

5.4.b üîÑ Ensure proper handling of async/await to maintain responsiveness.

5.4.c üö´ Make sure errors in async code are caught and dealt with, so they don‚Äôt cause silent failures.

### Minimize Memory

5.5.a üìä Store data late and dispose early. Be mindful of explicit disposal needs (such as controllers and listeners) versus garbage disposal.

5.5.b üßπ Properly manage memory to avoid leaks and use memory-efficient data structures to reduce your application's memory footprint.

5.5.c üí§ Use techniques like lazy loading and pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Cache

5.6.a üìä Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the need for frequent data retrieval and calculations. Minimize the size and frequency of data transfers, with efficient data formats and compression.

5.6.b üß† Avoid keeping large amounts of data in memory. Balance cache size and invalidation strategies to maintain speed without excessive memory usage.

5.6.c ‚ôªÔ∏è Ensure cached data is correctly invalidated or updated to avoid stale data issues.

## Technology

AI is used most effectively as an accelerator for experienced developers, and a drafting assistant for novices. Use AI with caution, and always review AI-generated content thoroughly.

### AI as an Accelerator

6.1.a üìå Experienced developers use code completion tools and LLMs to speed up coding tasks and generate boilerplate code. Use AI to explore new solutions and ideas efficiently.

6.1.b ‚ö†Ô∏è AI-generated code is never production-ready and should be used with caution. Always review and test AI-generated code thoroughly for fitness, reliability, and security.

### AI for Documentation

6.2.a üìù Do not use AI-generated comments that merely describe how code works or to describe complex logic. Focus instead on simplifying the code to make it more readable and self-explanatory.

6.2.b üìã AI can help articulate why code is written a certain way, providing context and rationale. Generate comments that explain design, trade-offs, and purpose, to help maintainers understand it better.

### AI Limitations

6.3.a üïµÔ∏è AI tools overlook critical details and make incorrect assumptions. Always perform a thorough review to ensure compliance with project requirements and standards.

6.3.b ‚úÖ Leverage AI to generate comprehensive test cases, especially for edge scenarios that might be easily overlooked, to enhance your testing strategy and code quality.

### Language

6.4.a üñ±Ô∏è You must actively use spelling and grammar checkers for all code and documentation. Language assistants are a vital quality control when working at speed.
